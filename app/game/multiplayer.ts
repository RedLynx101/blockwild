/**
 * Browser-only, host-authoritative WebRTC multiplayer transport for Blockwild.
 *
 * The host owns one RTCPeerConnection per guest (a star topology). Signaling is
 * deliberately manual: players copy an offer code to a guest, then copy the
 * answer code back to the host. Once connected, authoritative gameplay uses a
 * reliable ordered channel while short-lived pose updates use an unordered,
 * no-retransmit channel.
 *
 * This module contains transport, validation, and peer lifecycle only. It does
 * not mutate the voxel world; the game simulation consumes typed `message`
 * events, validates actions as host, and publishes authoritative snapshots.
