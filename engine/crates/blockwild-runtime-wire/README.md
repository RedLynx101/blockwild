# blockwild-runtime-wire

`blockwild-runtime-wire` is the single coarse binary boundary between the
browser shell and Blockwild's integrated Rust runtime. It is dependency-free,
bounded, versioned, and byte-tested against the TypeScript codec.

## Envelope

Every request is `BWRQ`; every response is `BWRS`. The fixed 44-byte
little-endian header contains wire version, runtime schema, operation, status,
reserved bits, request ID, client epoch, worker epoch, payload length, and a
16-byte payload checksum. Request IDs and client epochs are non-zero. Requests
carry worker epoch zero; every response carries a non-zero worker generation.
Reserved bits, unknown operations, trailing bytes, unsafe JavaScript `u64`
values, invalid UTF-8, and over-budget collections fail closed.

The outer operations are intentionally coarse: create/restore, reliable
command batch, fixed-step input batch, bounded extraction, checkpoint, and
shutdown. A command contains 1..256 opaque domain operations and is bound to
an exact authority identity, actor, idempotency key, payload checksums, and a
checksum over the complete command body. Domain type IDs are namespaced
strings so an unregistered future payload rejects without consuming a numeric
slot or being mistaken for a successful no-op.

`RuntimeInputFrameV1` is also a frozen ABI, not an anonymous numeric bag.
`moveX`/`moveZ` are signed-normalized axes; `lookYaw` is an absolute wrapped
heading with the i16 range mapped to `-PI..PI`, and `lookPitch` uses the same
normalized range. Button bits are jump, crouch, sprint, ascend/swim-up,
descend/swim-down, primary attack, secondary use, interact, mount/dismount,
creative-flight toggle, and drop (bits 0..10). State flags are creative,
flying, and mounted (bits 0..2). Unknown bits fail closed so a newer client cannot silently reinterpret an
older deterministic replay. Registered action bits whose native gameplay
dispatcher is not yet attached (attack, use, interact, mount, flight-toggle,
and drop) also reject rather than being accepted and ignored. All three state
flags currently reject as well: the browser cannot grant itself creative,
flight, or mounted eligibility by setting an input bit.

Limits shared with TypeScript include an 8 MiB envelope, 1 MiB per domain
operation, 6 MiB combined extraction, 128 input frames, 64 capabilities, and
JavaScript-safe integer revisions. Extraction hashes cover the exact five
length-prefixed render, HUD, audio, platform-request, and diagnostic channels.

R9 browser traffic uses one complete `BWRN` request as a single network domain
operation and returns one complete `BWNA` response. The integrated wire does
not decode its peer, agent, interest, or delta records.

R8 persistence has the same opaque semantic rule but a deliberately separate
bulk transport. A small `BWRB`/`BWRC` control envelope travels beside one
detached, transferable complete `BWPR` or `BWPA` attachment. This preserves the
normal BWRQ limits, avoids another structured-clone copy, and makes transfer
ownership and backpressure measurable. The browser transport allows at most two
outstanding attachment handoffs and 256 MiB of bounded recovery attachment
space. The Rust dispatcher independently caps the live queue at 32 requests,
64 MiB total, and 8 MiB per complete packet; additive recovery/import/export
pages remain capped at 4 MiB by their exact BWPR/BWPA schema.
The 256 MiB ceiling exists for bounded recovery/corruption handling, not normal
allocation. Persistence should emit chunked routine transactions. Normal
fixed-step, input, and command calls are selected ahead of the next queued bulk
call so a recovery stream cannot monopolize the authority worker. IndexedDB
remains a browser platform executor and never acquires journal authority.

The BWRQ/BWRS envelope deliberately uses `wire_checksum_v1` rather than
implicitly inheriting a state/replay hash. A protocol-owned checksum has a
frozen domain and raw-byte definition that can evolve independently from the
game's canonical-state hashing. The fixture corpus covers UTF-8, `0x80`,
`0xff`, invalid UTF-8, and TypeScript lone-surrogate rejection.

The legacy `CanonicalHasher::write_bytes` implementations do agree on high
bytes. A previous regression test incorrectly rotated an eight-bit value; Rust
actually widens to `u64` before `rotate_left(1)`. The corrected fixture keeps
the real parity vector and the bad-oracle vector so this false mismatch cannot
return. R8/R9 still require exact persisted-state, save, replay, and network
vectors, but there is no invented legacy blocker.

## Verification

`tests/fixtures/rust-engine/integrated-runtime-v1/wire-fixtures.json` is read
by both implementations. It covers exact TypeScript-to-native requests,
native-to-TypeScript receipts, re-attestation after restore, non-ASCII labels,
high binary bytes, checksum corruption, and lone-surrogate rejection. The
browser service tests separately prove serial worker ownership, awaited
idempotent receipts, crash/timeout/stale-generation failure, artifact
attestation, command/step/extraction latency budgets, exact detached
`BWRB`/`BWRC` bytes, transfer ownership, copy/byte telemetry, bulk backpressure,
normal-call priority, and shared crash/timeout invalidation. Protocol-test
kernels can exercise these invariants but can never report production
authority.

## Capability and authority boundary

Having a valid BWRQ/BWRS codec is not an authority promotion. The browser
service requires the content-addressed artifact plus the exact
`fixed-step-input-v1` and `bounded-extraction-v1` capabilities before it can
be production-authoritative. The Wasm facade intentionally advertises
`fixed-step-input-v1-pending-live-cutover` and
`bounded-extraction-v1-pending-live-domain-views` until those gates are proven;
it never promotes incomplete authority. `bulk-platform-v1` is present because
the Rust R8 dispatcher now owns real request IDs, transfer tokens, backpressure,
retry decisions, and durable BWPA validation. Its `BWDS` recovery-shell snapshot
preserves dispatcher work only; full runtime restore remains fail-closed until
R8 records rebuild world, entity, gameplay, and network authority. The
TypeScript R9 network adapter's type
IDs describe its opaque packet shape, not proof that a Wasm artifact has
registered the matching Rust decoder.

An application-level rejection that proves the expected authority state is a
normal awaited result. A malformed receipt, a changed state on rejection, a
worker timeout, a crash, an artifact mismatch, or a worker-generation mismatch
invalidates the complete runtime generation and requires an explicit
checkpoint restore plus re-attestation.
